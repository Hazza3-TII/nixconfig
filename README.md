# Humaid's NixOS configurations


## Manual setup

These are things that have to be setup manually after an installation:

- [ ] Copy over the files from borg (you need the keys)
- [ ] Setup symlink from /etc/nixos/configuration.nix to the host's config.
- [ ] Thunderbird: you need to login by yourself
- [ ] Firefox: Login to GitHub and other online services
- [ ] Signal: Login
