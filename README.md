# Humaid's NixOS configurations

## Hosts

- goral: A VM that runs on my M2 Macbook Air (current daily driver)
- serow: My ThinkPad T590
- tahr: My work-provided ThinkPad P1
- duisk: The server that runs huma.id

## Manual setup

These are things that have to be setup manually after an installation:

- [ ] Setup symlink from /etc/nixos/configuration.nix to the host's config.

## TODOs

- Secret management
- Alacritty configuration
- i3 configuration
